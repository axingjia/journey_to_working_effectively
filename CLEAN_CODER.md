# FORWARD
* You've picked up this book, so I assume you are a software professional. That's good; so am I. And since I have your attention, let me tell you why I picked up this book.
* It all starts a short time ago in a place not too far away. Cue the curtain, lights and camera, Charley...
* Several years ago I was working at a medium sized corporation selling highly regulated products. You know the type; we sat in a cubicle farm in a three-story building, directors and up had private offices, and getting everyone you needed into the same room for a meeting took a week or so.
* We were operating in a very competitive market when the government opened up a new product.
* Suddenly we had an entirely new set of potential customers; all we need to do was to get them to buy our product. That meant we had to file by a certain deadline with the federal government, pass an assessment audit by another date, and go to market on a third date.
* Over and over again our management stressed to us the importance of those dates. A single slip and the government would keep us out of the market for a year, and if customers couldn't sign up on day one, then they would all sign up with someone else and we'd be out of business.
* It was the sort of environment in which some people complain, and others point out that "pressure makes diamonds".
* I was a technical project manager, promoted from development. My responsibility was to get the website up on go-live, so potential customers could download information and, most importantly, enrollment forms. My partner in the endeavor was the business-facing project manager, whom I'll call Joe. Joe's role was to work the other side, dealing with sales, marketing, and the non-technical requirements. He was also the guy fond of the "pressure makes diamonds" comment.
* If you've done much work in corporate America, you've probably seen the finger-pointing, blamestorming, and work aversion that is completely natural. Our company had an interesting solution to that problem with Joe and me.
* A little bit like Batman and Robin, it was our job to get t hings done. I met with the technical team every day in a corner; we'd rebuild the schedule every single day, figure out the critical path, then remove every possible obstacle from that critical path. If someone needed software; we'd go get it. If they would "love to" configure the firewall but "gosh, it's time for my lunch break", we would buy them lunch. If someone wanted to work on our configuration ticket but had other priorities, Joe and I would go talk to the supervisor.
* Then the manager
* Then the director
* We got things done.
* It's a bit of an exaggeration to say that we kicked over chairs, yelled, and screamed, but we did use every single technique in our bag to get things done, invented a few new ones along the way, and we did it in an ethical way that I am proud of to this day.
* I thought of myself as a member of the team, not above jumping in to write a SQL statement or doing a little pairing to get the code out the door. At the time, I thought of Joe the same way, as a member of the team, not above it.
* Eventually I came to realize that Joe did not share that opinion. That was a very sad day for me.
* It was Friday at 1:00pm; the website was set to go live very early the following Monday.
* We were done. "DONE". Every system was go; we were ready. I had the entire tech team assembled for the final scrum meeting and we were ready to flip the switch. More than "just" the technical team, we had the business folks from marketing, the product owners, with us.
* We were proud. It was a good moment.
* Then Joe dropped by.
* He said something like, "Bad news. Legal doesn't have the enrollment forms ready, so we can't go live yet."
* This was no big deal; we'd been held up by one thing or another for the length of the entire project and had the Batman/Robin routine down pat, I was ready, and my reply was essentially, "All right partner, let's do this one more time. Legal is on the third floor, right?"
* Then things got weird.
* Instead of agreeing with me, "Joe asked, "What are you talking about Matt?"
* I said, "You know. Our usual song and dance. We're talking about four PDF files, right? That are done; legal just has to approve them? Let's go hang out in their cubicles, give them the evil eye, and get this thing done!"
* Joe did not agree with my assessment, and answered, "We'll just go live late next week. No big deal."
* You can probably guess the rest of the exchange; it sounded something like this:

        Matt: "But why? They could do this in a couple hours."
        Joe: "It might take more than that."
        Matt: "But they've got all weekend. Plenty of time. Let's do this!"
        Joe: "Matt, these are professionals. We can't just stare them down and insist they sacrifice their personal lives for our little project."
        Matt: (pause) "...Joe...what do you think we've been doing to the engineering team for the past four months?"
        Joe: "Yes, but these are professionals".

* Pause
* Breath.
* What. Did. Joe. Just. Say?
* All the time. I thought the technical staff were professionals, in the best sense of the word.
* Thinking back over it again, though. I'm not so sure.
* Let's look at that Batman and Robin technique a second time, from a different perspective. I thought I was exhorting the team to its best performance, but I suspect Joe was playing a game, with the implicit assumption that the technical staff was his opponent. Think about it. Why was it necessary to run around, kicking over chairs and leaning on people?
* Shouldn't we have been able to ask the staff when they would be done, get a firm answer, believe the answer we were given, and not be burned by that belief?
* Certainly, for professionals, we should... and, at the same time, we could not. Joe didn't trut our answers, and felt comfortable micromanaging the tech team--and at the same time, for some reason, he did trust the legal team and was not willing to micromanage them.
* What's that all about?
* Somehow, the legal team had demonstrated professsionalism in a way the technical team had not.
* Somehow, another group had convinced Joe that they did not need a babysitter, that they were not playing games, and that they needed to be treated as peers who were respected.
* No, I don't think it had anything to do with fancy certificates hanging on walls or a few extra years of college, although those years of college might have included a fair bit of implicit social training on how to behave.
* Ever since that day, those long years ago, I've wondered how the technical profession would have to change in order to be regarded as professionals.
* Oh, I have a few ideas. I've blogged a bit, read a lot, managed to improve my own work life situation and help a few others. Yet I knew of no book that laid out a plan, that made the whole thing explicit.
* Then one day, out of the blue, I got an offer to review an early draft of a book; the book that you are holding in your hands right now.
* This book will tell step by step exactly how to present yourself and interact as a professional. Not with trite cliche, not with appeals to pieces of paper, but what you can do and how to do it.
* In some cases, the examples are word for word.
* Some of those example have replies, counter-replies, clarifications, even advice for what to do if the other person tries to "just ignore you."
